    Coding with Chrome provides a easy and simple way to start programming on Chrome,
    out of the box.<br>
    This Guide explains the basics of Coding with Chrome: loading and saving a file,
    elementary editing, adding assets to the file library and the preview and export functions.
  </p>

  <h2>The different modes of Coding with Chrome</h2>
  <p>
    Coding with Chrome has two modes: "Simple Mode" and "Advanced Mode".<br>
    You can adjust the mode on the right side over the select box.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>Simple Mode</h3>
  <p>
    The "Simple Mode" is for beginners and should help to learn the basic of coding.<br>
    It provides some simple commands to create or draw objects like
    <code>draw.circle(20,20,50);</code> for drawing a circle.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> In the "Simple Mode" you can only use the JavaScript editor;
    any HTML and CSS code is completely ignored!
  </p>
  <h3>Advanced Mode</h3>
  <p>
    The "Advanced Mode" allows you create more complex code.<br>
    Here you have access to the javascript, html and css editor.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> In the "Advanced Mode" the simple commands will not work!
  </p>

  <h2>Entering / Editing code</h2>
  <p>
    In order to begin entering code, you must select one of the modes.<br>
    Depending on your selected mode you can enter your code in the JavaScript,
    HTML or CSS editor.
  </p>
  <h3>JavaScript Editor</h3>
  <p>
    Code entered in this editor will be placed in the header between
    &lt;script&gt;…&lt;/script&gt;.<br>
    You don't need to include any &lt;script&gt;…&lt;/script&gt; in this editor.
  </p>
  <h3>HTML Editor</h3>
  <p>
    Code entered in this editor will be placed in the HTML body between
    &lt;body&gt;…&lt;/body&gt;.<br>
    You don't need to include any doctype, body or header in this editor.
  </p>
  <h3>CSS Editor</h3>
  <p>
    Code entered in this editor will be placed in the style definitions between
    &lt;style&gt;…&lt;/style&gt;.<br>
  </p>

  <h2>Basic edit commands</h2>
  <p>
    If you type a long line, you will notice that the editor will not word-warp your line,
    but will scroll the content instead.<br>
    If you make a mistake, you can use the BackSpace key, Delete key or the undo and redo function
    inside the toolbar.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> Each editor has its own undo / redo history, so make sure you are inside the
    correct one.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Other features</h2>
  <p>
    Coding with Chrome offers some hot keys for editor features as well; please take a look
    at the Keyboard Shortcuts for more details about this.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Loading / Saving a file</h2>
  <p>
    Coding with Chrome is only able to load and save ".cwc" files.
    These ".cwc" files includes the settings, the content of the different editors and
    the content of the file library if it was used.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>File Library</h2>
  <p>
    The file library is on your left side and includes all files which are needed for
    your current project.<br>
    This makes sure that you only need to take care of the important stuff and don't need to take
    care of the file system or path to the different assets.<br>
    Your file library is also include inside the ".cwc" file for easy sharing.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>Adding a file to the file library</h3>
  <p>
    To add a file to the file library click on "Add file" and select the file you want to use.<br>
    The file will be automatically convered and add to the file library.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>Preview a file in the file library</h3>
  <p>
    By clicking on the name inside of the file library you will see a small preview of the file in
    the little area above the file library.<br>
    Please keep in mind that this only works for supported files from your OS.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>Use a file from the file library</h3>
  <p>
    To use a file from the file library, select the file and the button "Insert file" should be
    enabled.<br>
    If you now click on "Insert file" the specific macro for this will be inserted in the current
    editor.<br>
    Please keep in mind that you need to add the correct element for your usage.<br>
    <br>
    Example: &lt;img src="{lb}{lb} file:your_filename.jpeg {rb}{rb}"&gt; to insert your image in
    the HTML editor.
  </p>
  <h2>Preview function</h2>
  <p>
    By clicking the "run" button or by selecting "Code &gt; Run" from the file menu your current
    code will be executed in your preview window.<br>
    The Preview will be executed in a sandbox and will log all errors seperately.<br>
    If the script takes too long you have the option to terminate the preview at any time.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> You can also use CTRL + RETURN to update the preview window after a change.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Export features</h2>
  <p>
    If you only want to share the result, but not the whole source code, you can export your
    code.<br>
    If you export your code to an HTML file you can use it in any modern browser or upload it to
    a webserver.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> The export function only provides the content of the preview window, so it is not
    possible to load such .html file in Coding with Chrome editor to see the original source code.
